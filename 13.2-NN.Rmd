# Neural Networks

TBC ...

Both Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks employ some kind of data transformation that moves them into a higher dimensional space. What the kernel function does for the SVM, the hidden layers do for neural networks. For example, the output layer in the network performs a linear separation of the transformed data.

Are Neural Networks is better than Support Vector Machines?  The following post by [Igor F.](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/510052/are-neural-networks-better-than-svms) gives a nice starting example.  Let's start with this simple example:
