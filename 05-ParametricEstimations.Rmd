According to Breiman, there are two "cultures":  
**The Data Modeling Culture** : One assumes that the data are generated by a given stochastic data model (econometrics) ...  
**Algorithmic Modeling Culture**: One uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown (machine learning) ...    

He argues that the focus in the statistical community on data models has:
  
- Led to irrelevant theory and questionable scientific conclusions; 
- Kept statisticians from using more suitable algorithmic models; 
- Prevented statisticians from working on exciting new problems.  

In **parametric econometrics** we assume that the data come from a generating process that takes the following form:

$$
y=X \beta+\varepsilon
$$

Model ($X$'s) are determined by the researcher and probability theory is a foundation of econometrics


In **Machine learning** we do not make any assumption on how the data have been generated:

$$
y \approx m(X)
$$

Model ($X$'s) is not selected by the researcher and probability theory is not required

Nonparametric econometrics makes the link between the two: **Machine Learning: an extension of nonparametric econometrics**
   
To see the difference between two "cultures", we start with parametric modeling in classification problems.

# Parametric Estimations

So far we have only considered models for numeric response variables. What happens if the response variable is categorical? Can we use linear models in these situations? Yes, we can.  To understand how, let's look at the model that we have been using, ordinary least-square (OLS) regression, which is actually a specific case of the more general, generalized linear model (GLM).  So, in general, GLMs relate the mean of the response to a linear combination of the predictors, $\eta(x)$, through the use of a link function, $g()$. That is,  

\begin{equation}
\eta(\mathbf{x})=g(\mathrm{E}[Y | \mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x}]),
  (\#eq:5-1)
\end{equation} 

Or,  

\begin{equation}
\eta(\mathbf{x})=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1} x_{1}+\beta_{2} x_{2}+\ldots+\beta_{p-1} x_{p-1} = g(\mathrm{E}[Y | \mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x}])
  (\#eq:5-2)
\end{equation} 
  
In the case of a OLS,  

$$
g(\mathrm{E}[Y | \mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x}]) = E[Y | \mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x}],
$$
  
To illustrate the use of a GLM we’ll focus on the case of binary responses variable coded using 0 and 1. In practice, these 0 and 1s will code for two classes such as yes/no, committed-crime/not, sick/healthy, etc.  

$$
Y=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}{1} & {\text { yes }} \\ {0} & {\text { no }}\end{array}\right.
$$

## Linear Probability Models (LPM)

Let's use the same dataset, **Vehicles**, that we used in the lab sections and create a new variable, `mpg`:  

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#Inspect the data before doing anything
library(fueleconomy)  #install.packages("fueleconomy")
data(vehicles)
df <- as.data.frame(vehicles)

#Keep only observations without NA
dim(df)
data <- df[complete.cases(df), ]
dim(data)

#Let's create a binary variable, mpg = 1 if hwy > mean(hwy), 0 otherwise
mpg <- c(rep(0, nrow(data))) #Create vector mpg
data2 <- cbind(data, mpg) # add it to data
data2$mpg[data2$hwy > mean(data2$hwy)] <- 1
```
  
We are going to have a model that will predict whether the vehicle is a high mpg (i.e. `mpg` = 1) or low mpg (`mpg` = 0) car. As you notice, we have lots of character variables. Our model cannot accept character variables, but we can convert them into factor variables that give each unique character variable a number. This allows our model to accept our data. Let's convert them to factor variables now:  
  
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
for (i in 1:ncol(data2)) {
  if(is.character(data2[,i])) data2[,i] <- as.factor(data2[,i])
}
str(data2)
```

Done! We are ready to have a model to predict `mpg`.  For now, we'll use only `fuel`.  

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
model1 <- lm(mpg ~ fuel + 0, data = data2) #No intercept
summary(model1)
```
  
What we estimated is LPM.  Since $Y$ is 1 or 0,  

$$
E[Y | \mathbf{X}=\mathbf{Regular}]) = Probability(Y|X = \mathbf{Regular}),
$$
  
In this context, the link function is called "identity" because it directly “links” the probability to the linear function of the predictor variables. Let's see if we can verify this:  

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
tab <- table(data2$fuel, data2$mpg)
ftable(addmargins(tab))
prop.table(tab, 1)
```
  
Yes!  That's why OLS with a binary $Y$ is actually LPM.  That is,  

$$
Pr[Y = 1 | x=\mathbf{Regular}]) = \beta_{0}+\beta_{1} x_{i}.
$$
  
A more formal explanation is related to how $Y$ is distributed.  Since $Y$ has only 2 possible outcomes (1 and 0), it has a specific probability distribution.  First, let's refresh our memories about Binomial and Bernoulli distributions.  In general, if a random variable, $X$, follows the **binomial distribution** with parameters $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $p \in [0,1]$, we write $X \sim B(n, p)$. The probability of getting exactly $k$ successes in $n$ trials is given by the probability mass function:  

\begin{equation}
\operatorname{Pr}(X=k)=\left(\begin{array}{l}{n} \\ {k}\end{array}\right) p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k}
  (\#eq:5-3)
\end{equation} 
for $k = 0, 1, 2, ..., n$, where  

$$
\left(\begin{array}{l}{n} \\ {k}\end{array}\right)=\frac{n !}{k !(n-k) !}
$$
  
Formula 5.3 can be understood as follows: $k$ successes occur with probability $p^k$ and $n-k$ failures occur with probability $(1-p)^{n−k}$. However, the $k$ successes can occur anywhere among the $n$ trials, and there are $n!/k!(n!-k!)$ different ways of distributing $k$ successes in a sequence of $n$ trials. Suppose a *biased coin* comes up heads with probability 0.3 when tossed. What is the probability of achieving 4 heads after 6 tosses?  
  
$$
\operatorname{Pr}(4 \text { heads})=f(4)=\operatorname{Pr}(X=4)=\left(\begin{array}{l}{6} \\ {4}\end{array}\right) 0.3^{4}(1-0.3)^{6-4}=0.059535
$$
  
The **Bernoulli distribution** on the other hand, is a discrete probability distribution of a random variable which takes the value 1 with probability $p$ and the value 0 with probability $q = (1 - p)$, that is, the probability distribution of any single experiment that asks a yes–no question.  The **Bernoulli distribution** is a special case of the **binomial distribution**, where $n = 1$. Symbolically, $X \sim B(1, p)$ has the same meaning as $X \sim Bernoulli(p)$. Conversely, any binomial distribution, $B(n, p)$, is the distribution of the sum of $n$ Bernoulli trials, $Bernoulli(p)$, each with the same probability $p$.  

$$
\operatorname{Pr}(X=k) =p^{k}(1-p)^{1-k} \quad \text { for } k \in\{0,1\}
$$
  
Formally, the outcomes $Y_i$ are described as being Bernoulli-distributed data, where each outcome is determined by an unobserved probability $p_i$ that is specific to the outcome at hand, but related to the explanatory variables. This can be expressed in any of the following equivalent forms:  

\begin{equation}
\operatorname{Pr}\left(Y_{i}=y | x_{1, i}, \ldots, x_{m, i}\right)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}{p_{i}} & {\text { if } y=1} \\ {1-p_{i}} & {\text { if } y=0}\end{array}\right.
  (\#eq:5-4)
\end{equation} 
  
The expression 5.4 is the probability mass function of the Bernoulli distribution, specifying the probability of seeing each of the two possible outcomes. Similarly, this can be written as follows, which avoids having to write separate cases and is more convenient for certain types of calculations. This relies on the fact that $Y_{i}$ can take only the value 0 or 1. In each case, one of the exponents will be 1, which will make the outcome either $p_{i}$ or 1−$p_{i}$, as in 5.4.^[Intuitively, when $n=1$, achieving head once ($k=1$) is $P(head)= p^{k}(1-p)^{1-k}=p$ or $P(tail)= p^{k}(1-p)^{1-k}=1-p.$]  

$$
\operatorname{Pr}\left(Y_{i}=y | x_{1, i}, \ldots, x_{m, i}\right)=p_{i}^{y}\left(1-p_{i}\right)^{(1-y)}
$$
  
Hence this shows that  

$$
\operatorname{Pr}\left(Y_{i}=1 | x_{1, i}, \ldots, x_{m, i}\right)=p_{i}=E[Y_{i}  | \mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x}])
$$

Let's have a more complex model:  

```{r 5, echo=TRUE}
model2 <- lm(mpg ~ fuel + drive + cyl, data = data2)
summary(model2)
```
  
Since OLS is a "Gaussian" member of GLS family, we can also estimate it as GLS. We use glm() and define the family as "gaussian".  

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
model3 <- glm(mpg ~ fuel + drive + cyl, family = gaussian, data = data2)
#You can check it by comparing model2 above to summary(model3)
#Let's check only the coefficients  
identical(round(coef(model2),2), round(coef(model3),2))
```
  
With this LPM model, we can now predict the classification of future cars in term of high (`mpg` = 1) or low (`mpg` = 0), which was our objective.  Let's see how successful we are in identifying cars with `mpg` = 1 in our own sample.  

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#How many cars we have with mpg = 1 and mpg = 0 in our data
table(data2$mpg) 

#In-sample fitted values or predicted probabilities for mpg = 1
#Remember our E(Y|X) is Pr(Y=1|X)
mpg_hat <- fitted(model2)

#If you think that any predicted mpg above 0.5 should be consider 1 then
length(mpg_hat[mpg_hat > 0.5]) 
length(mpg_hat[mpg_hat <= 0.5])
```
  
This is Problem 1: we are using 0.5 as our threshold (discriminating) probability to convert predicted probabilities to predicted "labels". When we use 0.5 as our threshold probability though, our prediction is significantly off:  we predict many cars with `mpg` = 0 as having `mpg` = 1.  

And here is Problem 2:  

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
summary(mpg_hat)
```
  
The predicted probabilities (of `mpg` = 1) are not bounded between 1 and 0.  We will talk about these issues later.  First let's see our next classification model or GLM.  

## Logistic Regression
Linear vs. Logistic Probability Models, which is better and when?  We will briefly talk about it here. You can find a nice summary by Paul Von Hippel here as well (<https://statisticalhorizons.com/linear-vs-logistic>) [@Hippel_2015].  

First, let's define some notation that we will use throughout. (Note that many machine learning texts use $p$ as the number of parameters.  Here we use as a notation for probability.  You should be aware of it.)  

$$
p(\mathbf{x})=P[Y=1 | \mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x}]
$$

With a binary (Bernoulli) response, we will mostly focus on the case when $Y = 1$, since, with only two possibilities, it is trivial to obtain probabilities when $Y = 0$.  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{P[Y=0 | \mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x}]+P[Y=1 | \mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x}]=1} \\\\ {P[Y=0 | \mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x}]=1-p(\mathbf{x})}\end{array}
$$
  
An explanation of logistic regression can begin with an explanation of the standard logistic function. The logistic function is a sigmoid function, which takes any real input $z$, and outputs a value between zero and one. The standard logistic function is defined as follows:  

\begin{equation}
\sigma(z)=\frac{e^{z}}{e^{z}+1}=\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}
  (\#eq:5-5)
\end{equation} 

Let's see possible $\sigma(z)$ values and plot them against $z$.  

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
set.seed(1)
n <- 500
x = rnorm(n, 0,2)
sigma <- 1/(1+exp(-x))
plot(sigma ~ x, col ="blue", cex.axis = 0.7)
```

This logistic function is nice because: (1) whatever the $x$'s are $\sigma(z)$ is always between 0 and 1, (2) The effect of $x$ on $\sigma(z)$ is not linear.  That is, there is lower and upper thresholds in $x$ that before and after those values (around -2 and 2 here) the marginal effect of $x$ on $\sigma(z)$ is very low.  Therefore, it seems that if we use a logistic function and replace $\sigma(z)$ with $p(x)$, we can solve issues related to these 2 major drawbacks of LPM.  

Let us assume that $z = y = \beta_{0}+\beta_{1} x_{1}$, the general logistic function can now be written as:  

\begin{equation}
p(x)=P[Y=1|\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x}]=\frac{1}{1+e^{-\left(\beta_{0}+\beta_{1} x\right)}}
  (\#eq:5-6)
\end{equation} 


To understand why nonlinearity would be a desirable future in some probability predictions, let's imagine we try to predict the effect of saving ($x$) on home ownership ($p(x)$).  If you have no saving now ($x=0$), additional \$10K saving would not make a significant difference in your decision to buy a house ($P(Y=1|x)$).  Similarly, when you have \$500K ($x$) saving but without having house,  additional \$10K ($dx$) saving should not make you buy a house (with \$500K, you could've bought a house already, had you wanted one).  That is why flat lower and upper tails of $\sigma(z)$ are nice futures reflecting very low marginal effects of $x$ on the probability of having a house in this case.  

After a simple algebra, we can also write the same function as follows,  

\begin{equation}
\ln \left(\frac{p(x)}{1-p(x)}\right)=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1} x,
  (\#eq:5-7)
\end{equation}

where $p(x)/[1-p(x)]$ is called *odds*, a ratio of success over failure.  The natural log (ln) of this ratio is called, **log odds**, or **Logit**, usually denoted as $\mathbf(L)$.  Let's see if this expression is really linear. 
  

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
p_x <- sigma
Logit <- log(p_x/(1-p_x)) #By defult log() calculates natural logarithms
plot(Logit ~ x, col ="red", cex.axis = 0.7)
```

In many cases, researchers use a logistic function, when the outcome variable in a regression is dichotomous.  Although there are situations where the linear model is clearly problematic (as described above), there are many common situations where the linear model is just fine, and even has advantages.  Let’s start by comparing the two models explicitly. If the outcome $Y$ is dichotomous with values 1 and 0, we define $P[Y=1|X] = E(Y|X)$ as proved earlier, which is just the probability that $Y$ is 1, given some value of the regressors $X$. Then the linear and logistic probability models are:  

$$
P[Y = 1|\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x}]=E[Y | \mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x}] = \beta_{0}+\beta_{1} x_{1}+\beta_{2} x_{2}+\ldots+\beta_{k} x_{k},
$$
$~$

$$
\ln \left(\frac{P[Y=1|\mathbf{X}]}{1-P[Y=1|\mathbf{X}]}\right)=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1} x_{1}+\ldots+\beta_{k} x_{k}
$$

$~$

The linear model assumes that the probability $P$ is a linear function of the regressors, while the logistic model assumes that the natural log of the odds $P/(1-P)$ is a linear function of the regressors.  Note that applying the inverse logit transformation allows us to obtain an expression for $P(x)$.  With LPM you don't need that transformation to have $P(x)$.  While LPM can be estimated easily with OLS, the Logistic model needs MLE.  

$$
p(\mathbf{x})=E[Y | \mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x}]=P[Y=1 | \mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x}]=\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\beta_{0}+\beta_{1} x_{1}+\cdots+\beta_{p-1} x_{(p-1)})}}
$$
$~$

The major advantage of LPM is its interpretability. In the linear model, if $\beta_{2}$ is (say) 0.05, that means that a one-unit increase in $x_{2}$ is associated with a 5-percentage point increase in the probability that $Y$ is 1. Just about everyone has some understanding of what it would mean to increase by 5 percentage points their probability of, say, voting, or dying, or becoming obese.  The logistic model is less interpretable. In the logistic model, if $\beta_{1}$ is 0.05, that means that a one-unit increase in $x_{1}$ is associated with a 0.05 "unit" increase in the log odds, $\text{log}(P/{(1-P)})$, that $Y$ is 1. And what does that mean? I’ve never had any intuition for log odds.  So you have to convert it to the odd ratio (OR) or use the above equation to calculate fitted (predicted) probabilities.  Not a problem with R, Stata, etc.  

But the main question is when we should use the logistic model?  The logistic model is unavoidable if it fits the data much better than the linear model. And sometimes it does. But in many situations the linear model fits just as well, or almost as well, as the logistic model. In fact, in many situations, the linear and logistic model give results that are practically indistinguishable except that the logistic estimates are harder to interpret.  Here is the difference: **For the logistic model to fit better than the linear model, it must be the case that the log odds are a linear function of X, but the probability is not.**  


Lets review these concepts in a simulation exercise: 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#Creating random data
set.seed(1) # In order to get the same data everytime 
n <- 500 # number of observation
x = rnorm(n) # this is our x
z = -2 + 3 * x

#Probablity is defined by a logistic function
#Therefore it is not a linear function of x!
p = 1 / (1 + exp(-z))

#Remember Bernoulli distribution defines Y as 1 or 0 
#Bernoulli is the special case of the binomial distribution with size = 1
y = rbinom(n, size = 1, prob = p)

#And we create our data
data <-  data.frame(y, x)
head(data)
table(y)
```

We know that probablity is defined by a logistic function (see above).  What happens if we fit it as LPM, which is $Pr[Y = 1 | x=\mathbf{x}]) = \beta_{0}+\beta_{1} x_{i}$?

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
lpm <- lm(y ~ x, data = data)
summary(lpm)

#Here is the plot Probabilities (fitted and DGM) vs x. 
plot(x, p, col = "green", cex.lab = 0.7, cex.axis = 0.8)
abline(lpm, col = "red")
legend("topleft", c("Estimated Probability by LPM", "Probability"), lty = c(1, 1),
pch = c(NA, NA), lwd = 2, col = c("red", "green"), cex = 0.7)
```

How about a logistic regression?

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
logis <- glm(y ~ x, data = data, family = binomial)
summary(logis)
#Here is the plot Probabilities (fitted and DGM) vs x. 

plot(x, p, col = "green", cex.lab = 0.8, cex.axis = 0.8)
curve(predict(logis, data.frame(x), type = "response"), add = TRUE, col = "red", lty = 2)
legend("topleft", c("Estimated Probability by GLM", "Probability"), lty = c(1, 1),
pch = c(NA, NA), lwd = 2, col = c("red", "green"), cex = 0.7)
```

As you can see, the estimated logistic regression coefficients are in line with our DGM coefficients (-2, 3).
  
$$
\log \left(\frac{\hat{p}(\mathbf{x})}{1-\hat{p}(\mathbf{x})}\right)=-1.8253+2.7809 x
$$
Here again: **For the logistic model to fit better than the linear model, it must be the case that the log odds are a linear function of X, but the probability is not.**  

### Estimating Logistic Regression

Since Logit is a linear function:  

\begin{equation}
Logit_i = \log \left(\frac{p\left(\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{i}}\right)}{\left.1-p\left(\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{i}}\right)\right)}\right)=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1} x_{i 1}+\cdots+\beta_{p-1} x_{i(p-1)},
  (\#eq:5-8)
\end{equation} 

it seems that we can estimate it by a regular OLS.  But, we only observe $Y=1$ or $Y=0$ not $p(\mathbf{x})$. To estimate the $\beta$ parameters, we apply the maximimum likelihood estimation method.  First, we write the likelihood function, $L(\beta)$, given the observed data, which is technically a joint probability density function that can be written a product of $n$ individual density functions:    

$$
L(\boldsymbol{\beta})=\prod_{i=1}^{n} P\left[Y_{i}=y_{i} | \mathbf{X}_{\mathbf{i}}=\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{i}}\right]
$$
With some rearrangement, we make it more explicit:  

$$
\begin{aligned} L(\boldsymbol{\beta}) &=\prod_{i=1}^{n} p\left(\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{i}}\right)^{y_{i}}\left(1-p\left(\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{i}}\right)\right)^{\left(1-y_{i}\right)}  \end{aligned}
$$
With a logarithmic transformation of this function, it becomes a log-likelihood function, which turns products into sums.  Hence, it becomes a linear function:  

\begin{equation} 
\begin{split}
\begin{aligned}
\ell\left(\beta_{0}, \beta\right) &=\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_{i} \log p\left(x_{i}\right)+\left(1-y_{i}\right) \log (1-p\left(x_{i}\right)) \\
&=\sum_{i=1}^{n} \log (1-p\left(x_{i}\right))+\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_{i} \log \frac{p\left(x_{i}\right)}{1-p\left(x_{i}\right)} \\
&=\sum_{i=1}^{n} \log (1-p\left(x_{i}\right))+\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_{i}\left(\beta_{0}+\beta x_{i} \right) \\
&=\sum_{i=1}^{n} \log 1/(1+e^{z_i})+\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_{i}\left(z_i\right) \\
&=\sum_{i=1}^{n} -\log (1+e^{z_i})+\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_{i}\left(z_i\right),
\end{aligned}
\end{split}
(\#eq:5-9)
\end{equation} 
  

where $z_i = \beta_{0}+\beta_{1} x_{1i}+\cdots$.  

Now that we have a function for log-likelihood, we simply need to chose the values of $\beta$ that maximize it. Typically, to find them we would differentiate the log-likelihood with respect to the parameters ($\beta$), set the derivatives equal to zero, and solve.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \ell}{\partial \beta_{j}} &=-\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{1+e^{\beta_{0}+x_{i} \cdot \beta}} e^{\beta_{0}+x_{i} \cdot \beta} x_{i j}+\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_{i} x_{i j} \\
&=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(y_{i}-p\left(x_{i} ; \beta_{0}, \beta\right)\right) x_{i j}
\end{aligned}
$$
Unfortunately, there is no closed form for the maximum. However, we can find the best values of $\beta$ by using algorithm (numeric) optimization methods (See Appendix).  

### Cost functions

The cost functions represent optimization objectives in estimations and predictions.  In linear regression, it's a simple sum of squared errors, i.e.  

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{SSE}= \sum{(\hat{y}_i-y_i)^2} 
  (\#eq:5-10)
\end{equation} 
  
If we use a similar cost function of the linear regression in *Logistic Regression* we would have a non-convex function with many local minimum points so that it would be hard to locate the global minimum.  In logistic regression, as we have just seen, the log-likelihood function becomes the cost function. In the machine learning literature notation changes slightly:

\begin{equation}
J(\theta)=-\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m} y_{i} \log(h_{\theta}(x_{i}))+\left(1-y_{i}\right) \log (1-\log(h_{\theta}(x_{i}))),
  (\#eq:5-11)
\end{equation} 

where for each observation,  

$$
h_{\theta}\left(\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{i}}\right)=\frac{e^{\beta_{0}+\beta. x_{i}}}{1+e^{\beta_{0}+\beta. x_{i}}}
$$

This loss function is also called as [logistic loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_functions_for_classification#Logistic_loss) commonly used to optimize logistic regression models.  Because it is more common to minimize a function in practice, the log likelihood function is inverted by adding a negative sign to the front. For classification problems, “log loss“, “cross-entropy” and “negative log-likelihood” are used interchangeably.  Hence, equation 5.11, the negative log-likelihood, is also called as "cross-entropy" error function.  The cross-entropy loss function can be used other nonparametric classification problems, as we will see later.  

Now that we have a cost function, we simply need to chose the values of $\beta$ that minimize it. Due to difficulties in multi-dimensional analytic solutions, we use gradient descent and some other types of algorithmic optimization methods.  

The same cost function can be written when $y_i \in \{+1,-1\}$

$$
g_i(\mathbf{w})= \begin{cases}-\log \left(p\left({\mathbf{x}_i}^{T} \mathbf{w}\right)\right) & \text { if } y_{i}=+1 \\ -\log \left(1-p\left({\mathbf{x}_i}^{T} \mathbf{w}\right)\right) & \text { if } y_{i}=-1\end{cases}
$$
  
We can then form the *Softmax* cost for Logistic regression by taking an average of these Log Error costs as
  
$$
g(\mathbf{w})=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} g_{i}(\mathbf{w}) .
$$
  
It is common to express the Softmax cost differently by re-writing the Log Error in a equivalent way as follows. Notice that with $z = \mathbf{x}^{T} \mathbf{w}$
    
$$
1-p(z)=1-\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}=\frac{1+e^{-z}}{1+e^{-z}}-\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}=\frac{e^{-z}}{1+e^{-z}}=\frac{1}{1+e^{z}}=p(-z)
$$
  
Hence, the point-wise cost function can be written as

$$
g_{i}(\mathbf{w})= \begin{cases}-\log \left(p\left({\mathbf{x}}_{i}^{T} \mathbf{w}\right)\right) & \text { if } y_{i}=+1 \\ -\log \left(p\left(-{\mathbf{x}}_{i}^{T} \mathbf{w}\right)\right) & \text { if } y_{i}=-1\end{cases}
$$

Now notice that because we are using the *label* values $\pm 1$ we can move the label value in each case inside the inner most parenthesis, 

$$
g_{i}(\mathbf{w})=-\log \left(p\left(y_{i} {\mathbf{x}}_{i}^{T} \mathbf{w}\right)\right)
$$
Finally since $-\log (x)=\frac{1}{x}$, we can re-write the point-wise cost above equivalently as
  
$$
g_{i}(\mathbf{w})=\log \left(1+e^{-y_{i} \mathbf{x}_{i}^{T} \mathbf{w}}\right)
$$
  
The average of this point-wise cost over all $n$ points we have the common Softmax cost for logistic regression: 
  
$$
g(\mathbf{w})=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} g_{i}(\mathbf{w})=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \log \left(1+e^{-y_{i} \mathbf{x}_{i}^{T} \mathbf{w}}\right)
$$
  
This will be helpful when we make the comparisons between logistic regression and support vector machines in Chapter 15.  
  
### Deviance
You have probably noticed that the output from `summary()` reports the “deviance” measures. The "Null deviance" is the deviance for the null model, that is, a model with no predictors. The null deviance shows how well the response variable is predicted by a model that includes only the intercept (grand mean).  What is **deviance**? (See also <https://bookdown.org/egarpor/SSS2-UC3M/logreg-deviance.html>) [@Eduardo_LabNotes].  

It is defined as the difference of likelihoods between the fitted model and the saturated model:  

\begin{equation}
D=-2 \ell(\hat{\beta})+2 \ell(\text { saturated model })
  (\#eq:5-12)
\end{equation} 
  
This is also known as the *Likelihood Ratio Test* (LRT) that has been used to compare two nested models.  

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{L R T}=-2 \log\left(\frac{L_{s}(\hat{\theta})}{L_{g}(\hat{\theta})}\right)
  (\#eq:5-13)
\end{equation} 
  
where $L_s$ in 5.13 is the likelihood for the null model and $L_g$ is the likelihood for the alternative model.  

The perfect model, known as the saturated model, denotes an abstract model that fits perfectly the sample, that is, the model such that $P[Y=1 | \mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x}]=Y_{i}$.  Since the likelihood (LH) of the saturated model is exactly one, then the deviance is simply another expression of the likelihood:  

$$
D=-2 \ell(\hat{\beta})
$$
As a consequence, the deviance is always larger than or equal to zero, being zero only if the fit is perfect. Hence higher numbers always indicates bad fit. A benchmark for evaluating the magnitude of the deviance is the null deviance,  

$$
D_{0}=-2 \ell\left(\hat{\beta}_{0}\right)
$$
which is the deviance of the worst model, the one fitted without any predictor, to the perfect model. The null deviance serves for comparing how much the model has improved by adding the predictors. This can be done by means of the (Pseudo) $R^{2}$ statistic, which is a generalization of the determination coefficient in multiple linear regression:  

\begin{equation}
R^{2}=1-\frac{D}{D_{0}}=1-\frac{\text { deviance (fitted logistic, saturated model) }}{\text { deviance (null model, saturated model) }}
  (\#eq:5-14)
\end{equation} 
  
This global measure of fit shares some important properties with the determination coefficient in linear regression: It is a quantity between 0 and 1. If the fit is perfect, then $D = 0$ and $R^{2}=1$.  

Keep in mind that these are available for parametric models.

### Predictive accuracy

Another way of evaluating the model's fit is to look at its predictive accuracy. When we are interested simply in classifying, that is the value of $Y$ as either 0 or 1, but not in predicting the value of $p(x)$, such as  

$$
\hat{Y}=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}{1,} & {\hat{p}\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{k}\right)>\frac{1}{2}} \\ {0,} & {\hat{p}\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{k}\right)<\frac{1}{2}}\end{array}\right.
$$
then, the overall predictive accuracy can be summarized with a matrix,  

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}{\text { Predicted vs. Reality}} & {{Y}=1} & {{Y}=0} \\ {\hat{Y}=1} & {\text { TP }_{}} & {\text { FP }_{}} \\ {\hat{Y}=0} & {\text { FN }_{}} & {\text { TN }_{}}\end{array}
$$

where, TP, FP, FN, TN are **"True positives", "False Positives", "False Negatives", "True Negatives"**, respectively.  This table is also know as **Confusion Table**.  There are many metrics that can be calculated from this table to measure the accuracy of our classifier.  We will spend more time on this this subject under Chapter 10 later.
